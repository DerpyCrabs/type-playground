# type-playground

This is a language created for experimentation with type system design and implementation. Someday the type system of this language will be merged to [the Closkell language](https://github.com/DerpyCrabs/closkell).

This project is based on the source code and ideas from the [Ben Lynn's blog](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~blynn/lambda/).
